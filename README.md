#OC RPG

OC RPG is a small RPG that runs in the terminal.
This is the 3rd project of the OpenClassRooms iOS course.

This is quite a basic RPG.

2 Players create a team of 3 characters to fight each other.
The winner of the duel is the first player that takes down all the opponent's units.


There are 4 types of units for now :

- Fighter: The basic attacker. A good warrior !  
- Mage: His gift ? Heal his fellow partners !  
- Colossus: Tough and mighty, but he will not hurt you.  
- Dwarf: His axe will hit you hard, but his life bar is as short as his height.
