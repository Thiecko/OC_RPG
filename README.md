# OC RPG

OC RPG is a small RPG that runs in the terminal.
This is the 3rd project of the OpenClassRooms iOS course.

This is quite a basic RPG.

2 Players create a team of 3 characters to fight each other.
The winner of the duel is the first player that takes down all the opponent's units.

## Types of units

There are 5 types of units for now :

- Fighter: The basic attacker. A good warrior !  
- Mage: His gift ? Heal his fellow partners !  
- Colossus: Tough and mighty, but he will not hurt you. Can paralyze the enemy.  
- Dwarf: His axe will hit you hard, but his life bar is as short as his height.  
- Rogue: He moves stealthily , and might poison you with his sharp daggers.  

## Status alteration

By default, all characters have the Normal status. But there are 3 other ones that you can see during a battle.

- Poisoned: The Rogue has a chance to poison his enemy when attacking. For 3 turns, the poisoned character will lose from 3 to 8 HP.  
- Paralyzed: The Colossus has a chance to paralyze his enemy when attacking. For 3 turns, the paralyzed character will have a chance to not be able to hit his target.  
- Confused: The Dwarf has a chance to confuse himself when attacking his enemy. For 3 turns, the confused character will have a chance to hit a random character on the battlefield instead of his initial target.
